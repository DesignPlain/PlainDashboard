Annotations is a key value map stored with a resource that
may be set by external tools to store and retrieve arbitrary metadata. More
info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/annotations
--Note--: The Cloud Run API may add additional annotations that were not provided in your config.
If the provider plan shows a diff where a server-side annotation is added, you can add it to your config
or apply the lifecycle.ignore_changes rule to the metadata.0.annotations field.
Annotations with `run.googleapis.com/` and `autoscaling.knative.dev` are restricted. Use the following annotation
keys to configure features on a Service:
- `run.googleapis.com/binary-authorization-breakglass` sets the [Binary Authorization breakglass](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/run/deploy#--breakglass).
- `run.googleapis.com/binary-authorization` sets the [Binary Authorization](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/run/deploy#--binary-authorization).
- `run.googleapis.com/client-name` sets the client name calling the Cloud Run API.
- `run.googleapis.com/custom-audiences` sets the [custom audiences](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/alpha/run/deploy#--add-custom-audiences)
that can be used in the audience field of ID token for authenticated requests.
- `run.googleapis.com/description` sets a user defined description for the Service.
- `run.googleapis.com/ingress` sets the [ingress settings](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/run/deploy#--ingress)
for the Service. For example, `"run.googleapis.com/ingress" = "all"`.
- `run.googleapis.com/launch-stage` sets the [launch stage](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/troubleshooting#launch-stage-validation)
when a preview feature is used. For example, `"run.googleapis.com/launch-stage": "BETA"`
